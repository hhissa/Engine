// Three-pass sparse-voxel raymarching with baked indirect lighting:
//
//  Pass 1 ("voxelize"): evaluates the analytic scene SDF -- the union of
//  every static primitive currently registered with GeometrySystem -- and
//  bakes it into a sparse voxel field: a coarse indirection grid where each
//  cell either points at an allocated "brick" of fine SDF samples (only
//  where a surface actually passes through it) or is empty.
//
//  Pass 2 ("probe bake"): fills a regular 3D grid of indirect-light probes
//  by raymarching a sphere of directions from each probe against the
//  field pass 1 just baked, accumulating incoming light (direct light at
//  each gather ray's hit, plus whatever indirect light the previous
//  bounce's probe grid already found nearby), run kProbeBounceCount times
//  so light bounces a few times before settling — see
//  Builtin.ProbeBake.comp.glsl for the full technique (adapted from Inigo
//  Quilez's "simplegi" article) and bake_probes() below.
//
//  Both of the above run once per rebake() (construction, or a scene
//  edit) -- neither runs per frame.
//
//  Pass 3 ("render", repeating): every frame, marches a ray per pixel
//  against the baked field instead of evaluating the SDF directly — for
//  cells with no brick it skips straight across (the actual point of
//  sparsity: empty space costs one lookup, not per-voxel sampling), and for
//  bricked cells it trilinearly samples the fine distance values. Indirect
//  lighting at a hit comes from trilinearly sampling pass 2's baked probe
//  grid, not a re-evaluation -- like the voxel field itself, GI is baked,
//  not recomputed every frame.
